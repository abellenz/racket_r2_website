      <h2>RACKET</h2>

      <h1>Privacy policy</h1>
        <p>Your privacy is important to us. It is Racket's policy to respect your privacy regarding any information we may collect from you through our mobile apps, on our website, http://racket.app, and other sites we own and operate.</p>

        <h2>Information we collect</h2>

        <p>
          <b>Information you give us. </b>
          We only ask for personal information when we truly need it to provide a service to you. We collect it by fair and lawful means, with your knowledge and consent. We also let you know why we’re collecting it and how it will be used. For example, when you sign up for an account or message or communicate with others, including our support team, you may give us your name, username, email address, phone number, address, birth date, contact preferences, photos and gender. In limited circumstances, we may ask you for government issued ID to validate your identity when you are requesting support or to confirm that you’re eligible to use Racket or as required by law. Users can also report violations of our Terms of Service to our support team and they may include the content of your channels in those reports.
        </p>

        <p>
          <b>Information we get from your use of our Services. </b>
